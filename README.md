# Elevator-Algorithm WIP
You can compile and run this console application in any enviroment supporting python development.
PyCharm was used to create, compile and run this application.
You should simply follow the on-screen instructions to get an output from the application.

It requires 3 initial inputs:
  1. Length of the floor sequence - total number of the floor you want the elevator to stop at
  2. Each floor to stop at
  3. Starting position of the elevator

Thats all you need to know to work with the application. Have fun using it!
